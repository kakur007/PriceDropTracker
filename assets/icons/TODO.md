# Icon Placeholders - Action Required

## Current Status
The files in this directory (icon-*.png.txt) are **temporary placeholders** only.

## What Needs to Be Done
Before Chrome Web Store submission, you **MUST** replace these placeholder files with actual PNG icon files:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Requirements for Real Icons

### Technical Specifications
- **Format**: PNG (required by Chrome Web Store)
- **Transparency**: Supported (recommended for modern look)
- **Color space**: RGB
- **Sizes**: Exact dimensions (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128)

### Design Guidelines
1. **Simple and recognizable** - Icon should be clear at 16x16 size
2. **Consistent design** - All sizes should look identical, just scaled
3. **Good contrast** - Visible on both light and dark backgrounds
4. **Brand appropriate** - Represents price tracking/shopping/deals
5. **No text** - Icons should be symbolic, not contain readable text

### Suggested Design Ideas
- Shopping cart with price tag
- Downward arrow with dollar sign
- Price tag with notification badge
- Graph/chart showing price drop
- Magnifying glass over price tag

## For Development
During development, Chrome will display a **default gray icon** for the extension. This is normal and expected. The extension will function correctly without custom icons during development.

## Icon Creation Options

### Option 1: Design Yourself
- Use tools like:
  - Figma (free online design tool)
  - Adobe Illustrator
  - Inkscape (free desktop app)
  - Canva (online, has icon templates)

### Option 2: Hire a Designer
- Fiverr, Upwork, or 99designs
- Cost: $20-100 typically
- Provide designer with requirements above

### Option 3: Use Icon Generator
- Several online Chrome extension icon generators available
- Search for "chrome extension icon generator"

### Option 4: AI-Generated
- Tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion
- May need manual cleanup to exact sizes
